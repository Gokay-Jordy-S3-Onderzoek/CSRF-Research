## What is CSRF?

CSRF also known as cross-site-forgery is one of the many security vulnerabilities when making a web app.
CSRF allows an attacker to do execute actions that the client didn't intend to perform.
These CSRF attacks alllow the attacker to use the same origin policiy, which means they are allowed to access the api, if no protection is in place. These attacks are very well hidden, and are hard to notice for the user.

The attacks might be hidden as link on a webpage. For example a link in someones comment.
